# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project involves cleaning and exploring a COVID-19 dataset using Python. The goal is to understand the dataset structure, handle missing/inconsistent data, and uncover trends and patterns through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `covid19_data_cleaning_eda.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all the cleaning steps, visualizations, and insights.
- `covid_dataset.csv` – (optional) Dataset file used for analysis, or add a link below.

---

## 📊 Dataset Source

Dataset used: [COVID-19 Dataset from Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)  
(Or mention your dataset source like Kaggle, WHO, etc.)

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Tasks

- Removed missing and null values
- Standardized column names
- Converted data types (e.g., dates)
- Filtered unnecessary or duplicate records

---

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

- Analyzed total cases, deaths, recoveries by continent/country
- Identified trends over time using line plots
- Compared countries using bar plots and heatmaps
- Found correlations between features

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Highest COVID-19 cases were observed in North America(United States Virgin Islands)
- Wallis and Futuna in Oceania	 had the highest death rate relative to cases
- Positive correlation between tests and cases detected

---

## 💡 Future Work

- Time-series forecasting with ARIMA or Prophet
- Country-level comparisons
- Predictive modeling based on features like vaccination rate, testing, and GDP
